# Soccer-Player-agent
This project implements a PEAS-based intelligent agent that simulates the decision-making behavior of a soccer player using Python. The agent observes its environment through sensors such as ball distance, goal distance, and opponent proximity, and performs actions like moving, passing, shooting, or dribbling based on predefined rules.
